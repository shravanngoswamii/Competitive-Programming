Problem Statement (Solve in C++)

There are N boxes numbered 0 to N−1. Initially, box i contains Ai balls.

Takahashi will perform the following operations for i=1,2,…,M in order:
1. Set a variable C to 0.
2. Take out all the balls from box Bi and hold them in hand.
3. While holding at least one ball in hand, repeat the following process:
    Increase the value of C by 1.
    Put one ball from hand into box(Bi+C)mod N.

Determine the number of balls in each box after completing all operations.
