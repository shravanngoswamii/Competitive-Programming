Problem Statement (Solve in C++)

You are given integers X and Y, which satisfy at least one of X not equal to 0 and Y not equal to 0.
Find a pair of integers (A,B) that satisfies all of the following conditions. If no such pair exists, report so.

1) −10^18≤A,B≤10^18
2) The area of the triangle with vertices at points (0,0),(X,Y),(A,B) on the xy-plane is 1.

Constraints

1) −10^17≤X,Y≤10^17
2) (X,Y)!=(0,0)
3) X and Y are integers.

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X Y

Output
If there is a pair of integers (A,B) that satisfies the conditions, print it in the following format:
A B
Otherwise, print -1.

Sample Input 1
3 5

Sample Output 1
1 1

The area of the triangle with vertices at points (0,0),(3,5),(1,1) is 1. Thus, (A,B)=(1,1) satisfies the conditions.

Sample Input 2
-2 0

Sample Output 2
0 1

Sample Input 3
8752654402832944 -6857065241301125

Sample Output 3
-1
