I have wanted to start with DSA for a while, but I was not able to maintain consistency. I have given it multiple tries but you know how it goes. Now, I am giving it another shot, and this time, I'm making my journey public to maintain consistency. It's just an experiment, Let's see if it works!!

#Day1 of #CodingConsistencyChallenge
- Starting with Patterns of Raj Vikramaditya - Striver Bhaiya's A2Z DSA Playlist!! Already watched first two lectures.
